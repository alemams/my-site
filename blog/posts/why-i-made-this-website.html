  <p>I used to think a resume was enough. You list your skills, your experience, your education — and boom, you're in. But the more I grew in my career, the more I realized something was missing.</p>
  <p>A resume can say a lot about what you’ve done. But it says almost nothing about who you are.</p>
  <p>That’s when it hit me — I needed something more personal, more dynamic, more me. So I built this website. And honestly? You probably should too.</p>

  <h2>🧠 A Website Tells Your Story</h2>
  <p>Let’s be honest — recruiters and employers are flooded with resumes every day. Most of them look the same.</p>
  <p>But a website is alive. It shows how you think, what you care about, and how you present yourself.</p>

  <h2>🌍 What My Site Says About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🛠 It shows that I can build something from scratch.</li>
    <li>🌍 It reflects my journey — from Syria to Canada.</li>
    <li>🧠 It demonstrates technical skills and personality.</li>
    <li>📝 It gives me a place to share ideas and growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Why You Should Build One Too</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Full control over your brand.</li>
    <li>✅ A place to showcase projects and writing.</li>
    <li>✅ A URL you can share on resume/LinkedIn/email.</li>
    <li>✅ A way to stand out.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💭 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever felt like a resume isn’t enough — it’s not. You’re more than bullet points.</p>
  <p>Build something that shows the full picture.</p>
